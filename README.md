# HomeDataWorkflow
The Jupyter Notebook in the repo is a quick analysis on data used in a previous class I took at the Unveristy of Michigan. In *SIADS 601: Qualitative Inquiry for Data Scientists* we were asked to interview candidates and make qualitative deductions off of those interviews surrounding a given dataset. However, the class ended there and we were unable to dive deeper into actually visualizing the *quantitative* data. For that reason, I am curious to do that here.

The dataset I chose can be found at (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arathipraj/house-data?resource=download) which provides a dataset of home prices from King County Washington (where I grew up!) from May 2014 to May 2015. It provides date sold with price along with a number of typical columns of information like sqft, beds, baths, grade, condition, year renovated, etc...

I am going to pick both <font color=purple>grade</font> (*An index from 1 to 13, where 1-3 falls short of building construction and design, 7 has an average level of construction and design, and 11-13 have a high quality level of construction and design*) and <font color=purple>waterfront</font> (*either 0 or 1*) to see what trends there are related to sale date and sale price.
